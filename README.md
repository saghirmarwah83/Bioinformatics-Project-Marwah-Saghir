Summary: This poster presents a systematic bioinformatics analysis of a target gene Arabidopsis thaliana chromosome:5 using sequence-based and comparative approaches. Starting from raw DNA sequence retrieval, key features such as ORFs, GC content, and conserved motifs were identified to predict gene functionality. Homologous sequences were analyzed to explore evolutionary relationships through phylogenetic analysis. Structural and functional annotations provide insights into the biological role of the gene. Overall, this study highlights the power of computational tools in understanding gene structure, function, and evolutionary significance, offering a strong foundation for future experimental validation.
